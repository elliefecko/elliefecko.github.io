    <h1>My Parade</h1>
            <p>When most people think of the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day parade, they think of the commercialized show with performances from current broadway shows and floats with slightly obscure celebrities. I think of 3:30 in the morning. My dad walked into my sister and I’s room, playing Do Me Do Duds from The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T from his computer with grainy audio quality. He played it at least three times while singing along in the most dramatic voice, like he does every year. And that was how we woke up.</p>
            <p>Within thirty minutes we were out the door with a full shopping cart full of supplies and a couple folding chairs. It's strange seeing the city that early. Wondering what the people in the few cars out are doing. Waiting at each stop light even though no one is there to wait for. We set up our space at about 70th street, putting our chairs down and using bungee cords to rope off our area. Once we're done I grab one of the donuts my dad picked up last night, before curling into a ball in a folding chair trying to rest a bit and warm up before the sun rises. And this same ritual repeats every year.</p>
            <p>For all the effort that it takes to watch in person and front row, my family does. We have ever since my dad was a kid. When my dad was a kid, however, they didn't have to wake up early to stake their claim. They would go to Central Park, right on the parade route, to where there was a giant rock, as there are many in the city. They would sit on “The Rock” with some other people and watch the parade from there. But before I was even born, they stopped being able to watch from he Rock.” But still I know, every year either my dad or my grandfather will make a snide remark about how they were kicked out of their spot.</p>
            <p>This tradition is such a big part of our family, that when, because of covid, we watched it on the TV, it was the first time in my life. Watching it on TV I truly saw how different our parade was from the parade that everyone else saw. They didn't feel the cold, while being bundled up in a thick winter coat and a blanket sitting on a little milk crate. They don’t see the actual important part of the parade. Seeing a 50 ft tall character slowly float into a crowd and out of the parade, while everyone around you starts ohhhhhing until the wind settles down. It's when the parade is over, realizing that it's only eleven, and the day has barely started. Watching the barriers start to be taken down while confetti is still scattered on the street, as it will fill your pockets randomly for the next three months. With the television version, everything has to be a perfect performance, while in reality, its clowns dressed up as butter throwing confetti in your face while on roller skates.</p>
            <p>Even if you watch it in person, there are two sides to the parade -- literally. There is the side of people standing on the concrete with the barriers laid out, and there is the side next to Central Park. The Central Park side has stadiums put up a few days before so that there is seating for the people who pay, and for the families of people in the parade. While we were there from 4:30 in the morning, about an hour before the parade actually started people started trickling in on the other side. This parade is a nationwide event, people see it from all over the world. But not to me. To me it is sitting with my family on uncomfortable chairs in the cold eating stale donuts. But that's better than the parade everyone else sees.</p>
